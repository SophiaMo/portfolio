summary: "We study how coworker networks influence sectoral job-switching decisions, using German administrative data and causal identification strategies. A general equilibrium model highlights the role of coworker networks in labor reallocation and shows that considering these networks amplifies the trade-off between aggregate welfare and inequality."

##### Abstract

Social networks influence labor market outcomes. We investigate how the sectoral composition of an individual’s current coworkers’ past employment affects job-switching decisions. To
identify causal effects, we employ multiple strategies, including distinguishing between current-year and non-current-year coworkers, controlling for time-varying shocks specific to the industry
pairs, and using unexpected death or retirement events to isolate idiosyncratic changes in coworker
networks. Using German administrative matched employer-employee longitudinal data, we find
a positive causal relationship between the proportion of coworkers from a sector and both the
propensity of transitioning to that sector and the sensitivity to sectoral wage changes. To quantify
the coworker mechanism’s contribution to employment and reallocation, we develop and estimate a multi-sector, multi-firm general equilibrium model where perceived wages and adjustment
costs for sector transitions depend on coworker shares. Our results show that the welfare effect of
COVID-induced productivity shocks is higher when considering coworker networks compared to
assuming no influence from coworkers. Maintaining worker-employer ties to reduce competition
in positively shocked sectors can further increase welfare.
